									<p style="padding: 0 0 1em 0;"><b>Client:</b> Park People <br> <b>Contact:</b> Adri Stark<br> <b>Client Industry:</b> Community Building Charity <br> <b>Supervisor:</b> Dr. David Roberts <br><b>Team:</b> Goldie Zhu, Maria Wilson, Jessica Spitzer, Victoria McCutcheon, Scarlett Mackay, Renna Cukier <br> <b>Timeline:</b> Sept. 2021 - Apr. 2022<br></p> 
								<hr />
									<h4 style="text-align:center;">Problem Statement</h4>
									<p><b>Problem:</b> People experiencing homelessness in parks are often met with a unique set of challenges and barriers that are not considered by park professionals. There are many characteristics of a park that can create a hostile environment, such as anti-homeless architecture, policing, and other uncompassionate approaches to homelessness.<br><br>
									<b>Our Solution:</b> Parks need to be redesigned to be accommodating of all park users while recognizing the systemic and structural failures that lead to homelessness. We created a resource that will guide park professionals on how to better meet the needs of unhoused people.</p>
								<hr />
									<h4 style="text-align:center;">Background</h4>
										<ul>
										  <li>Defensive architecture and ghost amenities negatively impacts all park users.</li>
										  <li>Creating fear and instability in parks prevents homeless people from seeking the care and help they need as they may fear their possessions being seized or stolen.</li>
										  <li>Shelters can be inaccessible or overcrowded while having restrictive rules for residents, such as not accommodating pets.</li>
										  <li>There are many systemic issues, such as a lack of affordable housing or lack of representation in public policy, as well as other individual circumstances that can lead to homelessness.</li>
										  <li>There is a lot of stigma and public judgement surrounding homelessness. Forcing instability in the lives of unhoused folks also makes it difficult for them to improve their circumstances.</li>
										  <li>With the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, it has become increasingly difficult for people to earn liveable incomes, find affordable housing, and meet basic personal needs.</li>
										  <li>Inaccessibility of hygiene, housing, banking, and other resources as well as potential personal disabilities makes it difficult for unhoused people to improve their situation.</li>
										  <li>Other issues include a lack of support and planning for individuals discharged from mental health, addiction, correctional, and hospital facilities as well as children aging out of the child welfare system.</li>
										  <li>Marginalized communities (BIPOC), who are already underrepresented in power and politics, are disproportionately represented in unhoused populations.</li> 
										  <li>People have a right to define what "home" is to them and all people should be welcomed in public spaces.</li>
										</ul>

									<h4 style="text-align:center;">Interviews</h4>
									<p><b>Limitations:</b> University of Toronto Ethics - We are not allowed to interview unhoused people directly<br></p>
									<p>The following park professionals and relevant stakeholders were interviewed:</p>

									<h4 style="text-align:center;">Choosing the Final Product Format</h4>
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="capstone_mucp_images/mucp_format.PNG" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
										<p>For our final deliverable, we decided that a guidebook would be the most accessible, sustainable, and feasible format.</p>
								
								<hr />
									<h4 style="text-align:center;">Ideation</h4>
									<p>We brainstormed on Miro based on four domains:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Problems and needs identified in interviews and research.</li>
										<li>Constraints when choosing what to include in the resource.</li>
										<li>Solutions that could help address the identified problems/needs.</li>
										<li>What needs further research or better understanding.</li>
									</ul>
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="capstone_mucp_images/mucp_ideation.PNG" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									<p>Based on the ideation and refinement, our resource consists of four sections:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Meet Basic Needs.</li>
										<li>Balance Safety and Privacy.</li>
										<li>Use a Harm Reduction Approach.</li>
										<li>Build Community.</li>
									</ol>
								<hr />
									<h4 style="text-align:center;">Final Product</h4>
								<hr />
									<h4 style="text-align:center;">Takeaways</h4>
										<li>Integrating features was a lot more time consuming and tedious than previously expected.</li>
										<li>I need to work on my knowledge and experience integrating features with other people's code.</li>
										<li>Team communication and distribution of work is very important. Our group worked well so it was a pretty seamless experience.</li>
										<li>Some people might struggle to ask for help so it is good to take initiative when deadlines are approaching.</li>
										<li>Set communication and decision making expectations with teammates. Some design decisions were made without team discussion so the final product could have met coding standards better, been more clean, and had a more straightforward file structure.</li>
										<li>Ensure client expectations and requirements are laid out early on. We did do this and yet, one of the "wishful requirements" still turned into an expected requirement.</li>
