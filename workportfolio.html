													<td>Media Analysis</td>
													<td>This purpose of this paper is to analyze how a current controversy (as of 2020) from FANG was covered in one media source. I chose the NPR article "Critics Slam Facebook But Zuckerberg Resists Blocking Trump’s Posts" by Shannon Bond, which covers the lack of action from Facebook over violent rheteric on its platform. I argue that although the article is informative, it is biased and written in a way that would influence readers to have certain opinions.</td>

													<td>Postmortem (remove?)</td>
													<td>This piece is about Google Glass and why it failed. <br> (Feedback: well written but incorrect citations, did not include enough about SCOT theory, did not abide by the SCOT approach -> didn't fulfil the requirements to receive a good grade but I still liked this paper, which is why I'm posting it.) <br>
														I would further my arguments in the paper to say that Google Glass was created as part of an attempt to control the attention economy. It offers no noteworthy benefits but was created to put information right in front of the user's eyes, which means that users would no longer have control over when and where to allocate their attention.</td>
